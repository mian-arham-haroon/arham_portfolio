# 👨‍💻 About Me

## 🚀 Introduction  
I’m **Mian Arham Haroon**, a driven **Data Science student** passionate about transforming data into meaningful insights. With a solid foundation in **Python, SQL, C++, and data analysis**, I actively build projects that solve real-world problems using **data visualization** and **machine learning** techniques.

I’ve developed various applications such as **Retail Management**, **Inventory Control**, and **Restaurant Systems** using tools like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**, and **Scikit-learn**. My goal is to bridge the gap between data and decision-making by creating value-driven solutions.
